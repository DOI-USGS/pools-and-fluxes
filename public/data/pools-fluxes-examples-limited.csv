pool,Rivers,1900,1250,2120,rivers,cubic kilometers,river.jpg,Water Resources - Multimedia | U.S. Geological Survey (usgs.gov),A natural body of water that flows from higher to lower elevations as a result of gravity. Rivers typically flow into lakes or to the ocean but sometimes end due to evaporation or through loss of streamflow to groundwater.

pool,Atmospheric moisture - over land,3000,2700,3300,atmospheric_moisture_over_ocean,cubic kilometers,NA,NA,Water that is present as water vapor (water in gaseous form) in the atmosphere above land masses. Water vapor in the atmosphere is invisible to the human eye.

pool,Reservoirs,10800,7000,15000,wetlands,cubic kilometers,NA,NA,"A reservoir is a human-made lake. Reservoirs form when a dam is built on a river, allowing water to pool behind the dam."
pool,Wetlands,14100,11000,17000,soil_moisture,cubic kilometers,wetlands.jpg,"Herring River Estuary, Cape Cod, MA | U.S. Geological Survey (usgs.gov)","Wetlands are areas where the soil is saturated or flooded year-round or during the growing season. Wetlands support the growth of aquatic (water) and terrestrial (land) plants that are adapted to grow in soils with low oxygen.  They include mangroves, marshes (salt, brackish, intermediate, and fresh), swamps, forested wetlands, bogs, wet prairies, prairie potholes, and vernal pools."

Most saline lakes exist in closed basins and do not have any outlet, meaning they do not release any water."
pool,Lakes - fresh,108000,91000,125000,permafrost,cubic kilometers,freshLake.jpg,Water Lake Nature - Free photo on Pixabay,"Fresh water accumulates in a low spot on the landscape as a result of surface-water runoff and groundwater seepage, resulting in a lake."

pool,Groundwater,22630000,8060000,23400000,ice_sheets_and_glaciers,cubic kilometers,NA,NA,Liquid water stored within cracks and pores in the rock beneath Earth’s surface.
pool,Ice sheets and glaciers,25800000,24064000,29200000,ocean_mixed_zone,cubic kilometers,Glacier.jpg,File:Grinnell Glacier from summit of Mt Gould 2015 7648 crop.jpg - Wikimedia Commons,"At high elevations or latitudes where snowpack persists year-round, the weight of the accumulated snow compresses it into ice. When the ice forms in a steep alpine environment, it slowly flows downhill, forming a glacier. Ice sheets are glaciers that have spread outward to cover an area larger than 50,000 square kilometers."
pool,Ocean - mixed zone,134000000,90000000,170000000,ocean_deep_water_zone,cubic kilometers,NA,NA,The upper portion of the ocean that is mixed by wind or by changes in salinity that result from evaporation or ice formation.
pool,Ocean - deep water zone,1206000000,1100000000,1300000000,streamflow_to_closed_basins,cubic kilometers,NA,NA,The lower portion of the ocean that is not mixed where very little light reaches.
flux,Streamflow to closed basins,800,600,1100,snowmelt,cubic kilometers per year,NA,NA,"Closed basins are basins where water flows into, but not out of the basin. Streamflow to closed basins does not flow to the ocean. Instead, streamflow ends in terminal lakes, in wetlands, is loss to groundwater, or evaporates. The water continues to move through the water cycle by evaporation or via groundwater recharge. Lakes in closed basins may be saline due to the accumulation of transported salts when water evaporates."
flux,Groundwater discharge to ocean,4500,100,6500,groundwater_discharge_to_ocean,cubic kilometers per year,NA,NA,The flow of fresh or saline water from groundwater aquifers to the ocean in coastal areas. Where land and ocean meet there is a mixing of fresh and saline water called the transition zone.
flux,Groundwater recharge,13000,12000,25000,groundwater_recharge,cubic kilometers per year,NA,NA,The process by which water is added to groundwater aquifers. Groundwater recharge occurs when water stored on or moving across the land surface infiltrates into the soil and then percolates through the soil to the saturated zone.
flux,human water use,24400,21000,25000,human_water_use,cubic kilometers per year,NA,NA,"We use water from rivers, lakes, reservoirs and groundater aquifers. We use that water to supply our homes and communities. We use it for agricultural irrigation and grazing livestock. We use it in industrial activities like thermoelectric power generate, mining, and aquaculture."
flux,Streamflow to ocean,36000,36000,56000,streamflow_to_ocean,cubic kilometers per year,NA,NA,The movement of fresh water from rivers into oceans.

flux,Evapotranspiration,68900,62000,75000,evapotranspiration,cubic kilometers per year,NA,NA,The sum of all processes by which liquid water is converted to water vapor and is released to the atmosphere.
